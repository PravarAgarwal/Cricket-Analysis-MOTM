# Cricket-Analysis-MOTM
Identify the Man of the Match in an Indian Primer League game by analyzing their performance throughout the game, keeping track of their batting and bowling records.
We aim to develop an End-to-end project in Data Science on the theme of Cricket Analysis. We will employ several techniques, algorithms, and ML Models in our
project. We will present a project starting from scratch by scraping data, then cleaning, analyzing, smoothing, and presenting. We will use Python, JS, Pandas, Microsoft Power BI, and several other tools during this project.
By the end, we will also try to develop the Ideal Playing XI of the tournament by running several ML Models and algorithms.
